# Data Analysis Project

## Overview

This project is focused on analyzing various datasets using multiple machine learning techniques, including clustering, multivariate analysis, and other data study methodologies. The notebooks in this repository provide detailed code and analysis for extracting insights from the data.

## Contents

The repository contains the following notebooks:

1. **Cluster Analysis (`cluster.ipynb`)**  
   - This notebook covers the clustering techniques used to group data based on similar characteristics. It includes:
     - Data preprocessing
     - Hierarchical clustering
     - Apriori algorithm
     - Visualizations of clusters

2. **Data Study (`data_study.ipynb`)**  
   - This notebook focuses on exploring the data, applying statistical methods, and performing data cleaning operations. It includes:
     - Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
     - Data transformations and feature engineering
     - Insights from descriptive statistics

3. **Multivariate Analysis (`multi_variate_analysis.ipynb`)**  
   - This notebook explores relationships between multiple variables and includes advanced analytical techniques such as:
     - Principal Component Analysis (PCA)
     - Correlation matrices
     - Dimensionality reduction techniques

## Installation

To run the notebooks in this repository, you will need the following libraries installed:

- `numpy`
- `pandas`
